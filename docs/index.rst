PHPUnit-Mink Documentation
==========================
This library is an extension for `PHPUnit <https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit>`_, that allows to write tests
with help of `Mink`_.

Overview
--------
This library allows to perform following things:

* use `Mink`_ for browser session control
* each test in a test case can use independent browser session
* all tests in a test case can share browser session between them
* Selenium server connection details are decoupled from tests using them
* perform individual browser configuration for each test in a test case
* support for `Sauce Labs <https://saucelabs.com/>`_
* remote code coverage collection
